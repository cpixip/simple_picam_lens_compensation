## Result from an example run of geo_05.py

* raw_B{0/1/2/3}.jpg   - raw input files, with all four different orientations possible.

* table_B{0/1/2/3}.h   - the lens compensation computed from the corresponding raw_Bx.jpg. All these tables should be bascially identical.

* x_raw_B{0/1/2/3}.jpg - lens compensated control images. Should show reduced color and intensity variations.

* t__B{0/1/2/3}.jpg    - lens compensated images taken with some RGB-colors for demo.
